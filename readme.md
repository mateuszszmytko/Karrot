# Karrot
Karrot is a simple library written in Typescript, which helps to manage DOM elements. Karrot is based on **reusable controllers** for attaching logic into elements, with some additional functionalities like hooks and other built-in utilities.

Karrot is great when used on traditonal sites (like based on wordpress etc) or on ambitious landing pages.<br>
***It's not a framework for SPA applications and bulding user interfaces.***


## Prerequisites
**Karrot** requires basic Javascript.

Before you start, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) installed.
