# Karrot
Karrot is a simple framework written in Typescript for help keep your code clean. Karrot is based on **reusable controllers** for managing elements, with some additional functionalities like **dependency injection**, built-in utilities and more.

Karrot is great when used on traditonal sites (like based on wordpress etc) or on ambitious landing pages.<br>
***It's not a framework for SPA applications and bulding user interfaces.***


## Prerequisites
**Karrot** requires basic Typescript (or Javascript if you want to), some basics of OOP concepts will be helpful aswell.

Before you start, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) installed.
